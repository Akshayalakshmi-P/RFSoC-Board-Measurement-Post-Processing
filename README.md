# RFSoC-Board-Measurement-Post-Processing
The primary goal of this project was to process wideband OFDM signals captured using a 4-Tx 2-Rx Xilinx RFSoC board.
The objective was to analyze these signals under varying angles of arrival (AOAs), perform time synchronization and frequency-domain transformation.and finally estimate and equalize the wireless channel to recover the transmitted data.
